# LibrarySystem
The goal of a public library is to provide members of the surrounding community access to books, periodicals, movies, music etc.  Library services include free rentals of inventory for up to 30 days and classes for learning new skills. 

After 30 days, a $1 per day fine is assessed. The library needs to be able to track what inventory is currently at the library, when the inventory leaves, which member it leaves with, and how to contact the member in case they donâ€™t return the item.

Some Use Cases are:

Library members can:

search/browse for library items, add to shopping cart, and check out
track the checkout status of each item in the library
return items to the library
track fines associated with late rental returns
add/update member info
search/view/sign up for classes
Admin can:

View/add/update/delete/deactivate library member
View/add/update/delete inventory items
View/add/update/delete employees
generate reports for:
List of members
Those with outstanding fines
List of all inventory items with count for checkouts, available, missing, and total
Most popular items checked out
List of class details and participant signups
